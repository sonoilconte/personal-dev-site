## Developer Portfolio Site

A mobile-first, single page, super simple UI site for featuring key projects, bio, LinkedIn, Github, etc.

The intention behind the design of the nav menu is to be phone friendly and enjoy avoiding hamburgers, drop-downs, slide-ins, etc. CSS transitions provide the fade effect on hash change to display the different 'pages'.
